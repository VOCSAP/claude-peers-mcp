// carries no key and is read by every other window; here each group gets its
// own directory, and that directory is a cache of the running session, never a
// history -- removed at exit for every scope kind, swept by age when the exit
// was not clean.
//
// Pure: node fs/path only, no electron import. The state root and the clock
// are injected by index.ts so this stays bun-testable on a throwaway tmp dir.
