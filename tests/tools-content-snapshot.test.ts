// The allow-list mechanism test's own set-equality assertion (served names
// vs TOOLS.map(name)) is structurally blind to a removal: both sides are
// derived from the same in-process TOOLS array in the same run, so a dropped
// tool disappears from both sides at once and the equality stays green.
// This file anchors on a committed snapshot instead -- a side that does not
// move when TOOLS does -- and symmetric-diffs it against the live array, so
// a removal fails by naming the missing tool and a legitimate addition fails
// by naming the fixture that needs a deliberate, reviewed update.
